/* Practice Set 7 â€” Functions
Covers:
- Declaring functions (declaration, expression, arrow functions)
- Parameters and arguments
- Return values
- Local vs global scope
Goal: Understand how to create reusable code using functions. */

// Questions:-

/* 
1. Create a function to print your name.
2. Create a function that accepts two numbers and prints their sum.
3. Create a function that returns the square of a number.
4. Create a function with multiple parameters and return a formatted string.
5. Demonstrate local vs global scope using variables inside and outside a function.

/*

}
sum(2,5);       //here we are just calling the function so it will just show the 5.

console.log(sum(2,3)); // here also by default "return value" has been returned when we call the function and their value is undefined.

 fun(); // This will print 6 as the "b" is local scope and we can use it in inside of the function only.
