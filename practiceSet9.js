/* Practice Set 9 â€” Objects
Covers:
- Creating objects with key-value pairs
- Accessing and modifying properties
- Adding methods to objects
- Nested objects and iteration with for...in
Goal: Get comfortable working with objects to represent real-world entities.
 */

//Questions:-

/* 
1. Create an object representing your favorite book with properties: title, author,
year.
2. Access and print the author property using both dot and bracket notation.
3. Add a new property "genre" to the object and print it.
4. Create a method in the object that prints a formatted description of the book.
5. Create a nested object representing a student with marks in 3 subjects and print
math marks.
6. Iterate over the object and print all property names and values.
