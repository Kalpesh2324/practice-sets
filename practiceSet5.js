/* Practice Set 5 â€” Conditionals
Covers:
- if, else, and else if statements
- switch statements for multiple conditions
- Building small programs with conditions (grades, age categories, days of the week)
Goal: Learn how to control the flow of your program using conditionals.
 */

// Questions:-

/* 
1. Write an if statement to check if a number is positive and print a message.
2. Write an if...else statement to check if a number is even or odd.
3. Write an if...else if...else to assign grades based on score.
4. Use a switch statement to print a message based on a day of the week.
5. Create a small program to check if a person is a child, teenager, adult, or senior based
on age using conditionals. 
*/

// Solutions:- 


/* 
let a = 12;
if(a>0){
console.log(`${a} is the positive number`);
}
 */


/* 
let a = 11;

if (a%2==0){
    console.log("It is an even number");

} else{
    console.log("It is an odd number.");
}

/* 
let score = 90;
